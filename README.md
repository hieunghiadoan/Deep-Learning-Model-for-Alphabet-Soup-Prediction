# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Model for Funding Success Prediction: Analysis Overview and Results

**Analysis Overview:**

The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a binary classification model using deep learning techniques to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset comprises information on over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup, including various metadata fields.

**Results:**

**Data Preprocessing:**

- **Target Variable(s):** The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL."
- **Feature Variable(s):** The feature variables include "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS," "NAME," and "ASK_AMT."
- **Variables Removed:** The "EIN" and "NAME" columns were initially removed from the input data as they serve as identification columns and do not provide useful features or targets. However, "NAME" was reintroduced in the last model.

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:**

- **Neural Network Structure:** The model comprises three hidden layers with 80, 30, and 1 neurons, respectively, utilizing ReLU activation functions. The output layer employs a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. This structure was chosen to balance complexity and the potential for overfitting while allowing the model to learn complex patterns in the data.

- **Model Performance:** The initial models achieved an accuracy of around 73%. However, the model named "3-AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation" outperformed the others with an accuracy of 78.85%. 

- **Feature Variable Adjustment:** In this optimized model, additional feature variables were included: "NAME."

**Steps Taken to Improve Model Performance:**

To enhance model performance, various steps were undertaken, including:

1. Dropping additional irrelevant columns.
2. Creating more bins for rare occurrences and adjusting bin sizes.
3. Modifying the number of neurons in a hidden layer.
4. Adjusting the number of hidden layers.
5. Experimenting with different activation functions.
6. Modifying the number of training epochs.

**Summary:**

The deep learning model achieved the desired performance with an accuracy of 78.85% in predicting the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations. Multiple attempts were made to optimize the model through data preprocessing and adjustments to the neural network structure.

As an alternative recommendation, ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest Classifier or Gradient Boosting Classifier could be explored to address this classification problem. These methods may offer improved accuracy and generalization while being less prone to overfitting compared to deep learning models. Further exploration of these alternative models could potentially enhance the accuracy of success predictions for funded organizations.
